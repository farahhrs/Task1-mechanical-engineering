### Movement angle:
I found the angle of movement depending on inverse kinematics, I assumed that we want to move robot's leg to the coordinate point: (57.55, 28). The the  value of x is 57.55 and the value of y is 28. As given to us that the length of the robot leg is 64 cm, now we have three values that represent the side lengths of a right-angled traingle. Depending on phitagors theory we can find the angle of the movement, Sin ùúÉ =
